1. Use yarn always for all package management tasks (install, add, remove, etc.)

2. Never deviate from code standards, always check to see if there is a reference for how to do something in the codebase before implementing

3. Follow existing code patterns and conventions found in the project

4. When in doubt, search the codebase for similar implementations before creating new code

5. Maintain consistency with existing file structure and naming conventions

6. Always run linting and formatting checks before committing code
